**Incentivizing Creative Workers: A Solution**

Creative workers such as developers, writers, composers, inventors, YouTubers, Twitterers, Redditors, etc., offer a tremendous amount of value to humanity.
Digital products that they make are inherently easy to copy, so humans have created solutions like copyrights, patents, licenses, trade secrets, etc.
These traditional mechanisms for protecting intellectual property have to do with secrecy: only a limited number of people have access to those products.
Monopolizing knowledge is a rent-seeking activity because knowledge is fundamentally free and universal.
The advertisement has recently become a model of generating revenue from free and open media without using paywalls.
Open source software is in fact advertisement because it is used as a reputation platform for software developers.
Contributors to and sponsors of open source software are not altruistic philanthropists; they are selfishly promoting their own brands.
The advertisement model has definitely helped shape the open culture of the web, but this model is too weak as an incentive mechanism.
Creative work is what makes the world a richer place, but due to the lack of sufficient incentives, few people are working on open source projects.
The motto "when we share, everyone wins" is simply wrong because creators don't win.
Software will not eat the world unless developers are adequately incentivized.
What we want is a world in which a large quantity of high-quality digital goods are openly accessible through a better incentive mechanism.

In this article, I propose a solution to the problem of incentivizing creative workers.
The core idea is to tokenize creative work.
This may sound similar to ICOs or NFTs, but it's different.
Below, I describe what it is and how it works.
In a nutshell, the workflow is as follows:

1. Create something, e.g., pull requests, tweets, videos, posts, data.
2. Mint a fungible token with no added functionalities.
3. Include a link to the minted token in the creative work and then publish it.
4. Sell the token little by little as popularity goes up.

The minted token should not serve as utility, security, nor governance.
There should be no specialized smart contract attached to the token.
Also, whitepapers should not exist.
During the ICO craze, fraudulent projects were rampant.
I think making promises in whitepapers is the root of all evil.
The token price should be determined by the objective value of the creative work rather than the trust in the creator.
Tokens should be issued after the product is made in order to avoid being considered by SEC to be a securities offering or a scam.
You should not raise capital instantly like a typical token sale.
Instead, you should slowly raise the price of the token.
Usually, NFT platforms require storing an IPFS hash of a digital item on-chain.
But in reality, storing a hash is not necessary because piracy will eventually be detected.
Proof of existence can be achieved by using timestamping services like OpenTimestamps or Wayback Machine.
OpenTimestamps is more censorship-resistant because it stores the hash on Bitcoin's network.

I also propose a "token basket," which is a mechanism to encourage collaboration.
A token basket is similar to a portfolio, an index fund, or an amalgamation of coins.
If a project consists of multiple contributions, one can create a weighted set of tokens.
This is useful when an investor is too busy to look into the details of a project but is confident that the project itself is good and the token basket is credible.
Like corporate stocks, project-based tokens suffer from the conglomerate discount.
Investors can spot important contributions.
This is also good for individual project contributors.
Traditional funding is project-based and contributors' salaries or grants are arbitrarily determined by fundraisers.
Tokens are fairer than salaries because salaries are determined by the few (the boss), whereas token prices are determined by the many (the market).
The wisdom of crowds suggests that the many are smarter than the few.
The token basket is a solution to the principal-agent problem.
However, buying hundreds of tokens simultaneously increases the number of transactions, resulting in high transaction fees.
This problem can be mitigated by creating a smart contract that locks a set of tokens and mints a single token.
Hierarchically constructing a token basket is a good idea.
Holders of the token basket can exchange it for the constituent tokens at any time.

One may wonder how such a useless token can have value.
But actually, usefulness has little to do with the token price.
One can copy Bitcoin, but the copy will never become as valuable as the original.
Digital tokens do not have intrinsic value.
Off-chain human interactions, contexts, and history are the source of value.
People buy a token because they believe that someone will later buy it at a higher price.
Bitcoin is a fungible art that only cryptographers can understand.
Mona Lisa is a non-fungible art that only artists can understand.
Of course, I do not understand Mona Lisa, but if someone sells it for $1, I would definitely buy it because I believe that it will be sold at a much higher price.
In essence, the value of a crypto asset is backed by its popularity.
Attention is the scarcest resource.
The word "speculation" comes from the Latin word "specere" which means "to look at."
The more eyes an asset attracts, the more valuable it becomes.
Understanding NFTs is hard.
In fact, understanding the value of NFTs in 2021 is as difficult as understanding the value of Bitcoin in 2013.
If you can understand its value, you are an early adopter.
Creating money out of thin air is like modern-day alchemy, but it is labor in the digital age.
Richest people made a fortune not through earnings but through the equity of the business they started.
In the investment world, no one is late.
Investors' job is to predict the future.
A market that has only a few things to invest in is boring.
The explosion of tokens allows you to put your money where your eyes are without doing your own research.
Investing is riskier but easier than inventing.
Hodling bitcoin is almost as stupid as hodling fiat.
Anyone can do that.
Swapping tokens actually fosters innovation.
Capital gain is a reward for inventors, discoverers, early adopters, risk-takers, auditors, beta testers, commenters, and retweeters.

The (dogfooding) [token](https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai/address/0x4d9849Ad68Ae7E0636B5CABCDe5fC5D695a69717) for this article is an ERC-20 token on the xDai Chain.
The total supply is 10<sup>18</sup> and the number of decimals is 18, so the token price is equal to the market cap.
The token is available on [Honeyswap](https://honeyswap.org), where you will need a [token list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1392782/1392782/main/tokenlist.json).
I used three links, but ideally, a link to an exchange with a URL parameter for the token address will obviate the need for this hassle.
If this token turns out to be successful, then this article's idea might be promising.
Please note that issuing a token in this way is a temporary solution.
I chose it because it seemed to be the easiest and cheapest way at the moment.
But from a security/decentralization perspective, this is not good, so I am going to research layer 2 technologies in the near future.
The proof of the pudding is in the eating.
Buying intellectual property is risky.
Society will shift from ads, SaaS, and bureaucratic seigniorage to token links, open innovation, and democratic seigniorage.
Tokens will separate the inextricably linked ideation and execution.
Selfish actors will be more beneficial to public goods than voluntary ones.
Finally, I warn you that this article is not investment advice.
Questions and comments are welcome.
